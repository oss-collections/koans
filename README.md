# Koans

A collection of zen like tutorials for high level programming languages.

The [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) walk you along the path to enlightenment
in order to learn programming. The goal is to learn the language, libraries, and
culture. Testing is essential in your quest to learn and do great things.

Other languages have similar projects.  This is a place for them to coexist.
